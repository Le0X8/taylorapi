	lyrics: [
		'Her name was Kitty',
		'Made her money being pretty and witty',
		'They gave her the keys to this city',
		"Then they said she didn't do it legitly, uh",
		'I bought a ticket',
		"She's dancing in her garters and fishnets",
		'50 in the cast, zero missteps',
		'Looking back, I guess it was kismet',
		'I waited by the stage door',
		'Packed in with the autograph hounds',
		'Barking her name',
		'Then glowing like the end of a cigarette',
		'Wow, she came out',
		'I said, "You\'re living my dream"',
		'Then she said to me',
		'"Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet',
		"You're sweeter than a peach",
		"But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",
		"And you're never, ever gonna",
		'Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay',
		"You're softer than a kitten",
		"So you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",
		'And you\'re never gonna wanna"',
		'She was a menace',
		'The baby of the family in Lenox',
		'Her father whored around like all men did',
		'Her mother took pills and played tennis',
		'So she waited by the stage door',
		'As the club promoter arrived',
		'She said, "I\'d sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life',
		'That\'s all mine"',
		"But that's not what showgirls get",
		'They leave us for dead',
		'Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet',
		"You're sweeter than a peach",
		"But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",
		"And you're never, ever gonna",
		'Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay',
		"You're softer than a kitten",
		"So you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",
		"And you're never gonna wanna",
		'I took her pearls of wisdom',
		'Hung them from my neck',
		'I paid my dues with every bruise',
		'I knew what to expect',
		'Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?',
		'They ripped me off like false lashes',
		'And then threw me away',
		'And all the headshots on the walls',
		'Of the dance hall are of the bitches',
		"Who wish I'd hurry up and die",
		"But I'm immortal now, baby dolls",
		"I couldn't if I tried",
		'So I say',
		'"Thank you for the lovely bouquet',
		"I'm married to the hustle",
		'And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe',
		"And I'll never know another",
		'Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (lipstick and lace)',
		'Sequins are forever, and now I know the life of a showgirl, babe',
		'Wouldn\'t have it any other way"',
		'(Thank you for the lovely bouquet) oh',
		"Wouldn't have it any other way",
		'(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)',
		'Hey, Kitty',
		'(Thank you for lovely bouquet)',
		'Now I make my money being pretty and witty',
		'Thank you for the lovely bouquet',
		'Thank you for an unforgettable night',
		'We will see you next time',
		'Give it up for the band',
		'And the dancers',
		'And of course, Sabrina',
		'I love you, Taylor',
		"That's our show",
		'We love you so much',
		'Goodnight!'
