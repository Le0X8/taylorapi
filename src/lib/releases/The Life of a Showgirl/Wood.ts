		"Daisy's bare naked",
		'I was distraught',
		'He loves me not',
		'He loves me not',
		"Penny's unlucky",
		'I took him back and then',
		'Stepped on a crack',
		'And the black cat laughed',
		"And baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious",
		'Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine',
		'Seems to be that you and me we make our own luck',
		'A bad sign, is all good',
		"I ain't got to knock on wood",
		"All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star",
		'Never did me any good',
		"I ain't got to knock on wood",
		"It's you and me forever dancing in the dark",
		"All over me, it's understood",
		"I ain't got to knock on wood",
		'Forgive me, it sounds cocky',
		'He (ah!) matized me',
		'And opened my eyes',
		'Redwood tree',
		"It ain't hard to see",
		'His love was the key',
		'That opened my thighs',
		"Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet",
		'To know a hard rock is on the way',
		"And baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious",
		'The curse on me was broken by your magic wand',
		'Seems to me that you and me we make our own luck',
		'New Heights of manhood',
		"I ain't gotta knock on wood",
		"All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star",
		'Never did me any good',
		"I ain't got to knock on wood",
		"It's you and me forever dancing in the dark",
