		'You thought that it would be ok, at first',
		'The situation could be saved, of course',
		"But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse",
		'Beware the wrath of masked crusaders',
		'Did you girl-boss too close to the sun?',
		'Did they catch you having far too much fun?',
		"Come with me, when they see us they'll run",
		'Something wicked this way comes',
		'Good thing I like my friends cancelled',
		"I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal",
		'Like my whiskey sour',
		'And poison thorny flowers',
		'Welcome to my underworld',
		'Where it gets quite dark',
		'At least you know exactly who your friends are',
		"They're the ones with matching scars",
		"It's easy to love you when you're popular",
		'The optics click, everyone prospers',
		"But one single drop, you're off the roster",
		'"Tone-deaf and hot let\'s all just off her"',
		'Did you make a joke only a man could?',
		'Were you just too smug for your own good?',
		'Or bring a tiny violin to a knife fight?',
		'Baby, that all ends tonight',
		'Good thing I like my friends cancelled',
		"I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal",
		'Like my whiskey sour',
		'And poison thorny flowers',
		'Welcome to my underworld',
		"It'll break your heart",
		'At least you know exactly who your friends are',
		"They're the ones with matching scars",
		'They stood by me',
		'Before my exoneration',
		'They believed I was innocent',
		"So I'm not here for judgement, no ...",
		"But if you can't be good",
		'Then just be better at it',
		"Everyone's got bodies in the attic",
		"Or took somebody's man",
		"We'll take you by the hand",
		"And soon you'll learn the art",
		'Of never getting caught',
		"It's a good thing I like my friends cancelled",
		"You know that I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal",
		'Like my whiskey sour',
		'And poison thorny flowers',
		"It's a good thing I like my friends cancelled",
		"I salute you if you're much too much to handle",
		'Like my whiskey sour',
		'I like it',
		'And poison thorny flowers, I love it',
		"Can't you see my infamy loves company",
		"Now they've broken you like they've broken me",
		'But a shattered glass',
		'Is a lot more sharp',
		'And now you know exactly who your friends are',
		'You know who we are',
		"We're the ones with matching scars"
