		'I heard you call me "Boring Barbie" when the coke\'s got you brave',
		"High-fived my ex, and then you said you're glad he ghosted me",
		'Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face',
		'Some people might be offended',
		"But it's actually sweet",
		"All the time you've spent on me",
		"It's honestly wild",
		"All the effort you've put in",
		"It's actually romantic",
		'I really gotta hand it to you, ooh',
		'No man has ever loved me like you do',
		"Hadn't thought of you in a long time",
		'But you keep sending me funny valentines',
		'And I know you think it comes off vicious',
		"But it's precious, adorable",
		'Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse',
		"That's how much it hurts",
		'How many times has your boyfriend said',
		'"Why are we always talking \'bout her?"',
		"It's actually sweet",
		"All the time you've spent on me",
		"It's honestly wild",
		"All the effort you've put in",
		"It's actually romantic",
		'I really gotta hand it to you, ooh',
		'No man has ever loved me like you do',
		"You think I'm tacky, baby",
		'Stop talking dirty to me',
		'It sounded nasty, but it',
		"Feels like you're flirting with me",
		"I mind my business, God's my witness that I don't provoke it",
		"It's kind of making me wet (oh)",
		"'Cause it's actually sweet",
		"All the time you've spent on me",
		"It's honestly lovely",
		"All the effort you've put in",
		"It's actually romantic",
		'Really got to hand it to you, to you',
		'No man has ever loved me like you do',
		"It's actually romantic",
		"(You've just given me so much)",
		'La-la-la-la, romantic (attention)',
		"It's actually romantic (it's so)",
		'Shoo-bop-bop, romantic'
