		'Elizabeth Taylor',
		"Do you think it's forever?",
		'That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée',
		"Ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me",
		'All the right guys',
		"Promised they'd stay",
		'Under bright lights',
		'They withered away',
		'But you bloom',
		'Portofino was on my mind and I think you know why',
		'And if your letters ever said, "Goodbye"...',
		"I'd cry my eyes violet",
		'Elizabeth Taylor',
		'Tell me for real',
		"Do you think it's forever?",
		'Been number one but I never had two',
		"And I can't have fun if I can't have...",
		'Be my NY when Hollywood hates me',
		"You're only as hot as your last hit, baby",
		'I been number one but I never had two',
		"And I can't have fun if I can't have... you",
		'Hey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?',
		'Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust... just kidding',
		"We hit the best booth at Musso & Frank's",
		'They say I\'m bad news, I just say, "Thanks"',
		"And you look at me like you're hypnotized",
		'And I think you know why',
		'And if you ever leave me high and dry',
		"I'd cry my eyes violet",
		'Elizabeth Taylor',
		'Tell me for real',
		"Do you think it's forever?",
		'Been number one but I never had two',
		"And I can't have fun if I can't have...",
		'Be my NY when Hollywood hates me',
		"You're only as hot as your last hit, baby",
		'I been number one but I never had two',
		"And I can't have fun if I can't have... you",
		'Elizabeth Taylor',
		"Do you think it's forever?",
		"If I can't have you",
		'All my white diamonds and lovers are forever',
		'In the papers, on the screen and in their minds',
		'All my white diamonds and lovers are forever',
		"Don't you ever end up anything but mine...",
		"I'd cry my eyes violet",
		'Elizabeth Taylor',
		'Tell me for real',
		"Do you think it's forever?",
		'Been number one but I never had two',
		"And I can't have fun if I can't have...",
		'Be my NY when Hollywood hates me',
		"You're only as hot as your last hit, baby",
		'I been number one but I never had two',
		"And I can't have fun if I can't have... you",
		'All my white diamonds and lovers are forever',
		'In the papers, on the screen and in their minds',
